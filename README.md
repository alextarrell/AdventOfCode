# My Advent of Code solutions
There's a fun holiday event known as the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) filled with a variety of themed coding challenges. It's quite fun and time permitting, I enjoy partaking in the event. This repo exists for the purpose of sharing in that fun with others.

Starting in 2020 a [script](/elf.py) was written to automate running tests and inputs. Note that earlier years are unlikely to run with this script, but it makes newer code much more convenient to run.

```
usage: elf.py [-h] [-d DAY] [-y {2015,2016,2017,2020}] [-l {python}] [--test] [--stream]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DAY, --day DAY     Target Day (default: None)
  -y {2015,2016,2017,2020}, --year {2015,2016,2017,2020}
                        Target Year (default: 2020)
  -l {python}, --language {python}
                        Target Language. If only one is available for the given problem it will be used automatically (default: None)
  --test                Runs test cases (if available) instead of solving (default: False)
  --stream              Streams the output in realtime. Useful for debugging issues (default: False)
```

Older solutions have been left relatively untouched. Only minor updates have been made in subsequent years to keep older code runnable. This keeps the style intact and is fun (for me at least) to see how my ability has improved over time.
